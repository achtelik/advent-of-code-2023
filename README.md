Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [achtelik][github] using
the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, achtelik is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

Advent of Code â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for
twenty-five days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.

# Conclusion

* Day 5 was a memory and performance issue.
* Day 8 was a pain, because you had to understand the structure of the data. Otherwise you get performance issues.
* Day 10 was not solvable for me :( I used java.awt.Polygon to check if the point is inside. :)
